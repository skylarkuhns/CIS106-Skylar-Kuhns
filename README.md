# CIS106-Skylar-Kuhns
There are two main reasons why i would like to take this course. The first and technical reason being it is simply a prerequisite to the main computer science couse, CSC 121. The second and more in-depth reason why i chose to take this course is that ever since i was a younger i have always had a fascination for computers and how they functioned. I have even put together several of my own. As i grew older and started thinking about possible future careers, i decided getting into the world of coding would be a good option. This is due in part of my early experience with computers and technology. I am thrilled to learn the various programming languages such as Python3. Learning to code overall is a great skillset to have especially as the tech industry continues to expand. From my perpsective, CIS 106 will be a great introduction to the world of programming.
